# Download

You can just download the .exe file. Nothing else should be required.

Alternatively if you have go installed and fyne setted up you can build it to .exe file with this command: 
```
go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui -o CHIMPS_calc.exe main.go
```
I only have windows so I don't know how to build it to other systems

# Note

This app is still under the development. Expect new features to be added and bugs to be fixed
